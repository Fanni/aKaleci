this is project about a marble game, the tradisional game based on real marble game in Indonesia (called kelereng).
Name of this project taken from "marble" in sundanesse language (kaleci) with "a" aditional in front of the name (a+kaleci become aKaleci).
This project is my final project in university actually and maybe about how the game played and description about the code will be wrote later. stay tune! :D
